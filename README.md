This web-application can be used to keep track of all our income and expenses.  

In order to keep track the progress application, i have written a document that describes the identified requirements. It could be found in this [drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12_Zdz3TU6wzlznwI5Gtbt9ivdJf7Si1F?usp=sharing).  

This document, together with the commits and the written source code, will serve as useful material to know the current project progress and keep track of which functionalities have not yet been developed.
